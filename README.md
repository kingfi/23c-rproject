# Data Analysis Project for HES 23C

This project analyzes the Global Party Survey, an expert-led survey of political parties around the globe. For full documentation surrounding both the survey and the dataset, please see the `/docs` directory of this repository.

Final project submission files are saved in the `/proj_submission` directory.

## Installation

## Structure

All modules are saved in the `/R` folder and are imported into both the `/vignettes` and the `/proj_submission` files. The `/proj_submission` folder also includes a brief overview pdf of the project and a handout pdf with our conclusions.
